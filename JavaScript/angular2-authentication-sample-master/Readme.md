# Add authentication to an Angular 2 app

This is a sample that shows how you can add authentication to an Angular2 app using the new router :D

## Using it

This demo relies on a server, we've created a [authentication server demo](https://github.com/auth0/nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample) to get you started. You'll need to clone it, run `npm install` then `npm start`. It will run a local server on port 3001.

Then, you can run `npm install` and `npm start` on this project. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
