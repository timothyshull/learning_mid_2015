<ul>
<li>a module that is defined and then called within a require as a dependency but not passed to the function will be
executed</li>
<li>A module with executable code that is required within a define within another module will be executed even if it is
not passed to the function</li>
<li>A module that simply passes an object within a define call will be available within another define or require to the
function as an assignable variable</li>
<li>A module that returns an object from a function will make that object available to another module as an object through
an argument within the internal function (same as previous)</li>
<li>Within a define, the first internal function that is encountered is always evaluated as require&#8217;s internal function
and not as a returnable function</li>
<li>A module that returns a function from define&#8217;s internal function will make that object available to another module as
a function through an argument within the internal function (same as previous)</li>
</ul>

<p>Possibilities -
1) No dependencies, simple object within define - passed to other modules and assignable through argument
2) Just executable code - passed to other modules within define, no need for argument assignment, only run when
processed within a require call (but, because module dependencies are loaded before a module, it will be run before the
module it is included in as a dependency)
3) Object returned from function within a define call - assignable within another define or require call through the
argument
4) Function returned from function within a define call - assignable within another define or require call through the
argument</p>

<p>All forms of the above become exposed as the returned value within the console by using
require(&#8220;module/name&#8221;).callSomeFunction()
Note this only works if &#8220;module/name&#8221; was previously loaded via the async version of require: require([&#8220;module/name&#8221;]).
If using a relative path, like &#8216;./module/name&#8217;, those only work inside define
Any module that has been defined([&#8220;module&#8221;]) is available in this way.</p>
