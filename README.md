#Learning Mid 2015

This repo is another collection of small projects that were completed to learn
many of the new tools in the JavaScript ecosystem as well as the basics of
some new languages. I generally approach my learning in these subjects the same
way I would learn a musical instrument; gradually consume more involved subject
matter but continuously repeating the basics to ensure that they are fully
internalized.
